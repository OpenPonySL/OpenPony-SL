The facial IK has 3 bones
The box rotation X controls the jaw
Box Z rotation control lip corners
Box Scale controls cheeks
Box location controls how open/closed the entire mouth is

Lip corners ALSO control
Rotation X, lip corners
Location, inbetween lips location


Images for the expression hud will fit into 4:3 if you input a 1:1 ratio texture
Recommend resolution for expressions is 128x128 or 256x256
In order to copy the style filter, do these steps
Enter Orthographic mode in blender
If you want a white background, turn on visablity for 'picture orthoplane'
Take a picture
Open a program of your choice
Open canvas of 128x128 or 256x256
Paste picture
Add a layer of solid white on top
Set to 25% opacity
Export as 128x128 or 256x256 


Using .anim is recommended

Hover is at priority 3
Flying is at 4
Flying and turning is at 5
Prejump at 4
Jumping at 3
Stands/Idles at 3 (to override SL breathing. Ear+facial animations should be avoided to avoid conflict)
Sitting at 3 (4 if youw ant to use pupils and COG)
Sits inside chairs 4
Tails at 2(Use 4 if you want to control Tail1)

A quick way to convert a normal ground sit to a chair based one, would be to enter the graph editor, select the COG + any IK bones you used, and hide all the elements but Z Location

Press g, then y, then press y, then type -0.4

This will offset any animation you have 0.4 meter backwards, this includes all the keyframes. You may have to repeat for up/down as well

For refence, sittingover mare 3 is 
0.4 meters backward and
meters below
 from what it originally is

Included in file has a box that represents the offset of where you sit while on a default cube rezzed in SL

With this cube, we can assume the offset is around 
0.475 meters behind, and 
0.119 meters below

TLDR;
Use the included 'Sit Cube' for sits on chairs

This will help standardize sit offsets

If your spine/torso is turning in the opposite way you're flying, increase your animation priority. This can happen with falling, jumping, or flying animations
