Auto alpha commands for clothing alphas.
You can also just use the script inside the extras kit and the alpha HUD's export while both are attached as well.

updatealpha 
Send a regionsayto owner on channel 20 to trigger an update of alphas

addalpha|lk(n)*face*face*lk(n)*face

(n) represents what link to effect, and face for which face to effect, supports multiple entries in a row. Duplicate numbers may act funny

Putting -1 in face, sets it to ALL_SIDES

ex addalpha|lk4*1*2*lk1*-1

This will hide face 1 and 2 on link 1 (01torsoupper) AND
all sides of link 7 ()
 
it will also repeat the command to the owner on channel 20. This is for addons or other things that want to use it. Has a built in delay of 0.08s per face. 

Formats as alpha|linkdesc|face|0
(basically nobody uses it but it exists)

The body keeps tracks of each face effected, and what attachments are associated with it, so running an update just checks if that attachment still exists

p.s in hindsight using bitwise to determine which face might've been ideal for this 11010000 or 208 would have been face 1,2, and 4
