The eyes have 6 layers, 5 layers editable by the customization head, leaving the 6th have the ability to work with expressions or other scripts.
layer 1,3,5 use alpha masking at 180
layer 2,4 use alpha blending
this is to hopefully discourage mixed alpha layering

Use 
left
texture|16pupils2|0|type|uuid|color♦gloss♦env|scale|alpha

right
texture|16pupils2|1|type|uuid|color♦gloss♦env|scale|alpha

to control those layers
