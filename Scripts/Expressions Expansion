Combo button for the Expression HUD formatting

Plays anim1 and anim2, stops layer1 and layer2, but will replay after the button is toggled off.

Reactive Gestures

An expansion on the sneeze to turn into a whole system with appliers/customization.

A new applier is added to the devkit/extras box

First time after you update/get a new pony, you will get a dialog to opt in or not, this can be toggled with a chat command later

*'/-19 Yes to that!' to enable
*'/-19 Not at all' to disable
A use case would be you get slapped, then you ragdoll/explode violently/returning a hug, without the need to press anything on your end.

It is possible to use prims, get by a hit car, then do a family guy death pose

Format:

trigger|anim1,anim2|sound1*vol*delay,sound2*vol*delay|range|mindelay|randomdelay|direction|chance|namecheck


trigger - represents the command that starts it
anim1/2 - Picks one of the animations to play randomly
sound1*delay*volume - Pick one of the random sounds to play with a certain delay and volume
range - Max distance someone needs to be to cause a reaction
mindelay - Minimum time before reaction occcurs
randomdelay - Additional time added to delay (randomized)
direction - Required direction of trigger, F for only punching forward (any,F,B,L,R combinations of FL/BR)
echochance - Chance to repeat/spread out of 100.0
check - If one of the attached items has part of this name, do not trigger

Example:

trig:sneeze|anim:ohno|snd:sneezing*1.0*0.1|range:15.0|delay:7|rand:32|dir:any|chance:12.0|check:mask

Anyone that has a name pattern with 'mask' will not trigger this reaction

Animation Format:
nameofanim_directiontouse

If direction is not defined, it will simple just play matching animation name/become the fallback
If no direction is valid and there is no fallback, it will do nothing

May have trouble with looping animations

Example:
anim1_F for the front
anim1_BR for back right
anim1_R for right (can also become FR/BR if those don't exist already)

To make a reaction pill

1) Unpack Reaction Applier from the devkit/extras
2) Create/Pick an (non-looping) animation, sound, and notecard to use
3) Setup notecard following format mentioned (make sure to not have multiple rangemult fields)
4) Put items into the applier (may need to rez if not fullperm)
5) Name the applier
6) Pickup/Use the applier
7) Create a gesture using your trigger keyword or alternative system (channel /-19)
